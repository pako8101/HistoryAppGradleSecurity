                     The history of tobacco use in the Americas goes back over 1,000 years when natives of the region chewed or smoked the leaves of the plant now known as Nicotiana rustica (primarily in the north) and Nicotiana tabacum (mostly in the south). After European colonization, tobacco would become the most profitable crop exported from the Americas.

This plant grew wild but came to be cultivated by the natives for use in religious rituals and hunting parties as it was thought
                        to expand the mind and heighten one's sensations overall. After 1492 CE,
                        European colonization of the West Indies and South and Central America shifted the focus of tobacco to
                        recreational use. By the mid-1500s CE,
                        tobacco had become the most profitable export from the Spanish and Portuguese colonies of the Americas,
                        primarily Nicotiana tabacum.

                      The Olympic Games began in Olympia, in 776 BC and took place every
                        four years until AD 393.They were held in honor of Zeus. At the first
                        Games, athletes competed in only one running event held on a single day. However, over the
                        years other events were added, and the Games eventually were expanded to five days.

                                <a> Discus
In the discus event the athletes threw a disk-shaped object for distance. The discus itself was made of stone or, later, iron, lead, or bronze.
                                </a>
                                <br>
<a> Long jump
To increase their distance, the athletes held weights.
                                They swung them above their heads on takeoff and threw them behind them before landing.

                                    <br>
Javelin
The javelin was a wooden rod with one end sharpened.
                                The athletes held a leather strap placed around the rod that helped them to throw the javelin farther.

                                    Equestrian events
Two- and four-horse chariot races as well as horse riding races made up the equestrian events. The owners of the chariots or horses, not the participants, won.
</a>
                                <a> <br>
Running events
There were four running events, all of which consisted of a predetermined number of laps in the stadium. In one race the athletes wore armor and carried a shield.
                                </a> <br>
                                <a>
Boxing
The athletes wrapped their hands and wrists in leather. Later they added metal on their knuckles. An athlete won when his opponent was knocked out or gave up.

                                <br>
                                <a>
    Wrestling
The athletes fought with bare hands while standing up. An athlete won after he forced his opponent’s hip, shoulder, or back to the ground three times.
